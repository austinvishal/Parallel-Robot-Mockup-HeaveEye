# Description of the Model

A new class of fully parallel 4-dof, 4-legged parallel mechanism, providing three rotational and one translational freedom. A fully parametric mathematical model of the mechanism kinematics have been created to support the analysis and verify conditions for singularity.

# Graphic Mockup

A library of graphical and computational tools has been written in order to simplify the analysis and to provide a sophisticated and effective mockup. A special geometry particularly feasible for laproscopic surgery has been investigated by flipping the mechanism.
